## What is LASER?

LASER is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. LASER is also a kind of light, which was first developed in 1960. 

We know that light of any kind is emitted from a source in the form of packets of waves. But LASER is different from normal light in a variety of ways. 
* Light form an ordinary source is a mixture of light of various wavelengths. On the other hand, in a LASER light each wave has almost the same wavelength. 
* The various waves in an ordinary light have no phase relation with each other. On the other hand, in a LASER light average length of the packet of waves is much larger, and so there is better phase correlation between the waves over a longer duration of time.

So, packets of light from an ordinary light source, like a bulb or a candle, are like an uncoordinated crowd passing through a gate and then dispersing in multiple directions. There footsteps are random too. However, packets of light from a LASER are like a bunch of soldiers, with well-coordinated footsteps. 

Because of these two reasons, when we pass an ordinary light through an aperture, it spreads pretty quickly and so obviously the beam size increases rapidly with distance. On the other hand, LASER light does not diverge so much after passing through an aperture. 


## Applications of LASER 

LASER has found application in a variety of fields ranging from science and technology to recreational activities. Let’s list down a few of these areas. 
* LASER light is used in fabrication and composition of CD (Compact Disc), and DVD (Digital Versatile Disc). It’s also needed to read and store data in them.
* LASER has been utilized to measure distance and time in an accurate manner. Not only can it measure long distances but even interatomic distances too.
* LASER is used to construct three dimensional holograms, which you will often see in LASER shows. 
* LASER can also be used for intricate surgeries. For example, Eximer Lassic Laser technique is used to operate on eyes if someone wants to discard glasses. LASER is also used for delicate surgery of glands in the stomach. 
* LASER also has various industrial applications, e.g. some LASERS are used to cut steel. 
* Some low power (around 0.5 mW) LASERS are also used as pencil LASER pointers. Probably, most of the students are familiar with this use of LASERS, isn’t it!
